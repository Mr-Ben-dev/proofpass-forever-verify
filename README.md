## 🌍 The Global Residency Crisis

> **2.3 billion people** lack trusted digital IDs (World Bank).  
> Governments deny asylum. Remote workers get blocked. Victims of fraud lose everything.  
> Centralized proof systems fail — they’re fragile, centralized, and hackable.

### 🔎 Centralized Systems Are Broken
| Issue | Reality |
|------|--------|
| **Data Loss** | Missed bills? Denied asylum. |
| **Document Fraud** | AI deepfakes ↑ 900% since 2023 (Sensity AI) |
| **No Sovereignty** | You don’t own your proof — platforms do. |
| **Slow Access** | Embassies request files via email… in 2025? |

> We need a **trust-minimized, persistent, user-owned proof of residency** — globally verifiable, immune to tampering.

## 🚀 Introducing ProofPass

> **The world’s first on-chain proof-of-residency network** powered by **Filecoin Onchain Cloud**.  
> Upload → Verify → Store → Prove — forever.

  <em>How ProofPass works: AI extracts address, stores via WarmStorage + PDP, issues sealed NFT proof.</em>
</div>

### ✅ Key Features
- 🛡️ **Tamper-proof Verification**: AI validates official documents (bills, leases), extracts address.
- 🔗 **PDP-Backed Storage**: Prove your file still exists — every 24h, verified on-chain.
- ⚡ **Instant Retrieval**: Access your proof globally in <1s via FilCDN.
- 💳 **Micropayments**: Pay \$5 in FIL/USDFC to issue or verify via FilecoinPay.
- 🧩 **Synapse SDK Integration**: One API call to verify: `verifyResidency(wallet)`.
- 🌐 **Developer API**: Build KYC, DeFi lending, or visa apps on top.

> Built for:
> - 🏚️ **Refugees** proving asylum claims  
> - 🌎 **Digital Nomads** renting abroad  
> - 💻 **DeFi Platforms** needing location-based access control

| **`Proof of Data Possession (PDP)`** | Daily verification that proof file still exists — crucial for long-term trust |
| **`FilCDN`** | Blazing-fast global retrieval (<1s) for embassies, platforms, users |
| **`FilecoinPay`** | Pay \$5 in FIL or USDFC to issue/verify a proof — streaming over 1h |
| **`Synapse SDK`** | Unified interface to manage storage, retrieval, payments, and PDP checks |

## 🧪 Developer Preview: Use ProofPass in Your App

Verify residency in **3 lines**:

```ts
import { Synapse } from '@filecoin/synapse-sdk';

const proof = await Synapse.verifyPDP(walletAddress, {
  region: 'EU',
  expiry: '2025-12-31',
});

if (proof.valid) grantAccess();


🌐 Use Cases:

* Visa applications
* DeFi credit scoring (prove regional compliance)
* NFT minting eligibility (geographic fairness)

💬 Feedback for Filecoin Onchain Cloud
We ❤️ the stack — here’s how to make it even better:

1. 
✅ Add Synapse.verifyPDP(address) method
→ Built-in SDK function to check PDP status of any deal — essential for apps like ours.

2. 
✅ Fiat On-Ramp in FilecoinPay
→ Most users don’t have FIL. Add Stripe → USDFC auto-convert for real-world adoption.

3. 
✅ PDP Alerts + Webhooks
→ Notify users if their proof fails PDP — critical for trust.
